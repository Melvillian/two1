#two1 library - OTB

Out of the box Python3 library (used in 21 Bitcoin Computer 1.0.0)


#why?
* port to linux?
* play around while waiting for 21 bitcoin computer to arrive?
* procrastinating other stuff?


# Requirements:
```
pip3 install -r two1/requirment.txt
```
and probably more, if porting is the goal
